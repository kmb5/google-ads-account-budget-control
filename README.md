# google-ads-account-budget-control
Account budget control script for Google Ads - supports all campaign types (including Smart Display)
NOTES:
- All campaigns are included when the spend is calculated
- AdsApp.campaigns() doesn't support Smart Display campaigns, so those have to be paused MANUALLY
