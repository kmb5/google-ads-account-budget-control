# Account Budget Control Script for Google Ads
Checks if the combined spend for a subset of campaigns (filtered by campaign name) is above a given budget - if yes, pauses the campaigns and sends an e-mail. **Important - Smart Display campaigns are not paused automatically - that has to be done manually!** There are also options for e-mail alerts at given thresholds (eg. 50% of the given budget) without pausing.
